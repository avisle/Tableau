# Analysis:
# In this NYC Citibike Analysis, I've created a map of where all the citibikes of the start location is located with exact latitude and longitudes. A lot of bikes are used in the central area of the city. The most bikes are borrowed in Central Park S & 6th Ave station. At the end of the trip, people return bikes across the whole city, there were no specific location that people prefer to return their bikes.
# People of all ages use citibikes, but the majority age group is around 28-40 years old. A lot of 40 years old use bikes at the start station, probably because that age group prefers to get their exercise in rather than taking other public transport station.
# The pie chart shows that there are more males than females using citibikes, but females bikes longer distance.
# Bike ID 17818 has very high usage.
